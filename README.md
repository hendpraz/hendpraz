# 👋 Hi there, I'm Hendry!

I'm a software engineer who loves building fast, clean, and reliable apps. I graduated from **Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung**, and I've been professionally developing mobile and web applications ever since.

### 🚀 Tech I'm Working With

- **Mobile:** Flutter, Kotlin, React Native
- **Frontend:** React, Svelte
- **Backend:** Node.js (Express), Python, SST (Serverless AWS)
- **Previously used:** Laravel, Django

### 🛠️ What I Do
- At work: building mobile apps (Flutter & Kotlin) for millions of users.
- In my free time: crafting minimalist, lightweight personal tools & apps — often using React, SST, Express, or Python.

### 📦 Side Projects
I love shipping small, purposeful projects and tools — often open-sourced and designed to replace apps I personally use.

> 💡 My goal: Build useful tools that are clean, fast, and easy to maintain.
