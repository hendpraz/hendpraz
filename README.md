## 👋 Hi there, I'm Hendry!

I'm a software engineer who loves building fast, clean, and reliable apps. I graduated from **Informatics, Institut Teknologi Bandung**, and I've been professionally developing mobile and web applications ever since.

### 🛠️ What I Do
- At work: building mobile apps (Flutter & Kotlin) for millions of users.
- In my free time: crafting minimalist, lightweight personal tools & apps — often using React, SST, Express, or Python.
